# About This Book
The 'Forever Edition' of this book is published on [LeanPub](http://leanpub.com), an "Agile" online publishing platform. That means the book is published as we write it, and *that* means although you may not have a complete book right now, you eventually will - and we'll also be able to revise it as needed. We also appreciate your patience with any typographical errors, and we appreciate you pointing them out to us - in order to keep the book as "agile" as possible, we're forgoing a traditional copyedit. Our hope is that you'll appreciate getting the technical content quickly, and won't mind helping us catch any errors we may have made. You paid a bit more for the book than a traditional one, but that up-front price means you can come back whenever you like and download the latest version. We plan to expand and improve the book pretty much forever, so it's hopefully the last one you'll need to buy on this topic!

You'll also find this book offered on traditional booksellers like Amazon. In those cases, the book is sold as a specific edition, such as "Second Edition." These represent a point-in-time snapshot of the book, and are offered at a lower price than the Agile-published version. These traditional editions do not include future updates.

If you purchased this book, thank you. Know that writing a book like this takes hundreds of hours of effort, during which we're not making any other income. Your purchase price is important to keeping a roof over our families' heads and food on our tables. Please treat your copy of the book as your own personal copy - it isn't to be uploaded anywhere, and you aren't meant to give copies to other people. We've made sure to provide a DRM-free file (excepting any DRM added by a bookseller other than LeanPub) so that you can use your copy any way that's convenient for you. We appreciate your respecting our rights and not making unauthorized copies of this work.

If you got this book for free from someplace, know that you are making it difficult for us to write books. When we can't make even a small amount of money from our books, we're encouraged to stop writing them. If you find this book useful, we would greatly appreciate you purchasing a copy from LeanPub.com or another bookseller. When you do, you'll be letting us know that books like this are useful to you, and that you want people like us to continue creating them.
