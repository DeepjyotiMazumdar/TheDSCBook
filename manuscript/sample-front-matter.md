This book is published on [LeanPub](http://leanpub.com), an "Agile" online publishing platform. That means the book is published as I write it. That means although you may not have a complete book right now, you eventually will - and I'll also be able to revise it as needed. I also appreciate your patience with any typographical errors, and I appreciate you pointing them out to me - in order to keep the book as "agile" as possible, I'm forgoing a traditional copyedit. My hope is that you'll appreciate getting the technical content quickly, and won't mind helping me catch any errors I may have made.
