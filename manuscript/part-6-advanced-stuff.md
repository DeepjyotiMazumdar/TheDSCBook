-# Part 6: Advanced Stuff
This is kind of our catch-all chapter for "extra information" that you may or may not find yourself in need of. We'll touch on troubleshooting, leading-edge stuff, some under-the-hood stuff, and stuff stuff. Note that many of these chapters will be under kind of constant expansion and revision, so if you purchased this book on LeanPub, make sure you're opted into "new release" notifications via email!
