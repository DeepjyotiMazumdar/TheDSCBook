-# Part 3: Testing the Infrastructure
In this Part, we'll walk through a couple of very basic scenarios. We'll assume that you have at least a client computer and a server, and that they're both running PowerShell v5. We'll set up a very basic configuration MOF and push it to the server. In doing so, that'll create a very basic (and not secure - so do this in an isolated lab) pull server, which we'll then use to test _that_ functionality quickly. 

It's worth noting that we assume you have a Windows 10 client, and a Windows Server 2016 server, available. This should also work with Windows Server 2012 R2, and with older clients running PowerShell v5 or later, but we haven't specifically tested it. We do _not_ cover setting up a complete lab environment; if you're playing with DSC, you should already be comfortable with that.
