# Testing Push Mode
As we described in the Part opener, in this chapter we will show you how to:

* Create a very basic configuration MOF that sets up a very basic, not-secure Pull server (securing it will require certificates, which we haven't gotten to, yet)
* Pushing the configuration to a server

Whether you follow along on your own computer or not is entirely optional.
