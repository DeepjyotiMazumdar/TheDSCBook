# Setting Up a DSC Lab
If you're interested in the quickest jump-start possible, then this is the chapter for you. We're going to walk you through the process of setting up a "model" DSC environment in an isolated lab environment. This should give you the "DSC experience" in a quick format, but we need to point out several very important caveats:

* What we're going to show you will not create a secure DSC environment. Because everyone's IT environment is different, there's no way for us to tell you what "secure" looks like without getting into DSC's design and planning. We do that in "Designing DSC," and you should read that before you start doing anything in production.
* What we're going to show you to create will not necessarily be something you can take into production. That's because, again, your production needs aren't something we can anticipate. You may find that this lab is a fun experience, but that you need to do something entirely different in production. Just be aware of that.
* We're not, in this lab setup, going to walk through every possible permutation of DSC design and setup. We'll help you get a basic environment up and running, which you can then tweak and modify as you work through the rest of the book. Note that this book isn't meant to be a manual or a lab guide; it's meant to _teach_. But, if you have your own lab environment, then you can certainly experiment with the things you learn.

## Lab Requirements
