-# Part 1: Design Decisions
DSC isn't something you can just start installing. It's not a _solution_ like Exchange Server or SQL Server; you don't "install it, and then figure it out." DSC is a set of technology components, and they're designed to fit together in a lot of different ways, to accommodate a lot of different business needs. It's _critical_ that you understand these components _up front_, or you're likely to deploy something that's painful at best, and a security nightmare at worse.
