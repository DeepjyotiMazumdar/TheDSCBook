# Feedback
We'd love your feedback. Found a typo? Discovered a code bug? Have a content suggestion? Wish we'd answered a particular question? Let us know.

**First**, please have a chapter name, heading reference, and a brief snippet of text for us to reference. We can't easily use page numbers, because our source documents don't have any.

**Second**, understand that due to time constraints like having full-time jobs, we can't personally answer technical questions and so forth. If you have a question, please hop on the forums at [PowerShell.org](http://powershell.org), where we and a big community of enthusiasts will do our best to help.

**Then**, head to [the LeanPub website and use their email link](https://leanpub.com/the-dsc-book/email_author/new) to email us. We can't always reply personally to every email, but know that we're doing our best to incorporate feedback into the book.

**Finally**, accept our thanks!
