-# Part 2: Configuring the Infrastructure
With some of your design decisions made, you can start getting things set up in your environment. In this Part, we'll discuss setting up a Pull Server and configuring the LCM. Now, _we're assuming you've already started making some design decisions_, and as you read through these chapters, you should be able to start finalizing them. But one problem with DSC is that design can be a little of a chicken-and-the-egg situation. You probably won't know how you want your LCMs configured until you know how you're going to create and modularize your configurations. So while we're going to show you all the possibilities, we can't _recommend_ one to you - you may need to work through a bit more of the book so that you can start making some concrete decisions for your environment.
